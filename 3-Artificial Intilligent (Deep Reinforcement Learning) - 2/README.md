###### The PDF file 'Deep Reinforcement Learning' provides most of the theoretical and mathematical informations about Reinforcement Learning and Deep-RL.
###### I solved the D-RL inverted pendulum problem by using MATLAB, Simulink, and Simscape for environment interaction and 3D simulation. Additionally, I utilized the Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning Toolbox for training algorithms.

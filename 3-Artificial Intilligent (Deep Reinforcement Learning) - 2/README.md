#### The PDF file 'Deep Reinforcement Learning' provides most of the theoretical and mathematical informations about Reinforcement Learning and Deep-RL.
#### D-RL inverted inverted pendulum problems were solved by MATLAB, Simulink and Simscape for 3D simulation, and i used Deep Learning and Reinforcement learning toolbox for training algorithms.

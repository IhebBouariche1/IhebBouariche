# Welcome ðŸ‘‹ 

##### Hello, I am Iheb Bouariche, an electrical engineer with a licentiate degree and a current master's student in automation engineering with five years of experience in the engineering field. I am continually developing my skills and would love to share my projects and experiences with you on this platform. I really enjoy self-directed learning, and I am a big fan of technology. I became interested in technology at a young age when I purchased my first computer in 2008. I have acquired additional skills through online courses, reading papers and books, and practicing, and I usually summarize my knowledge and experiences on papers or as projects. Some of my supplemental skills include artificial intelligence, 3D design, communication networks, and digital manufacturing..

#### My Career brief

![alt text](https://github.com/IhebBouariche1/IhebBouariche/blob/main/2.jpg)

   Throughout my academic classes in electrical and automation engineering, I have learned a great deal. I began by studying the mathematical representation of physical linear systems through differential equations on the time domain. I then delved into the mathematics behind the Fourier transform, which is used to transform differential equations on the time domain into transfer functions on the frequency domain for simplified dynamic system analysis. I learned a variety of techniques to study system performance on the frequency domain, such as pole positioning and diagrams like the Bode and Nyquist diagrams, among others. Next, I moved on to studying state representation systems with single/multiple inputs/outputs, which provides a full study of a system's internal dynamics.

Afterward, I learned about classical techniques for controlling systems, such as feedback control, PID control, and pole placement control, among others. I also learned how to move from continuous systems to discrete systems, which involves using digital calculators for physical systems control, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors, for better and more effective system control. These techniques are called digital control methods, such as numerical PID, RST, IMC (internal model controller), and others.

I also studied system identification, where I learned various methods for extracting transfer functions or mathematical models of a dynamical system using input-output signal measurement. Additionally, I learned about machine control, where I studied how to control a machine's velocity and current and implement feedback control with the use of a PID controller. I also learned about nonlinear systems and how to linearize, represent, study, and control these types of systems.

Lastly, I studied instrumentation, where I learned about sensor and actuator technologies, as well as PLCs devices used for controlling these systems using different languages such as Grafcet and Ladder language. I completed four practical professional training works and practical academic works, as well as supplement training works on my own, where I applied my theoretical knowledge to improve my experimental skills in instrumentation and system control.

   Artificial intelligent is one of the technologies that I loved and I have learned by myself, I learned AI from different sources, formations, article, papers, books, and then I started practicing AI with using of Python Language and MATLAB software, I started by supervised learning from data and preprocessing of data to machine learning to deep learning, I understood the theorical and mathematical fundamentals behind these concepts and finally I did some mini projects where I trained AI Neural Networks models with using python language and open source libraries and data, finally I summarized these informations on one report. I moved then to Reinforcement learning fundamentals then to deep Reinforcement Learning where machines could be train and learn by defining only an objective and with its interaction with the environment without using of data. I started by learning theorical and mathematical details about RL, then I worked on solving Markov decision problems with traditional RL algorithms, after that, I moved to more complex models, and they were solved by using Deep RL and with using of my previous knowledge on deep learning neural networks. On my latest projects, I applied AI on system control and I solved different types of control systems problems by Deep reinforcement learning on MATLAB software.

   Communication networks, one of the most important technologies that I have learned. I got my networks skills by learning communicationâ€™s hardware devices and software application, first of all I started by studying different communication nodes devices such as routers, switches, hubs, computers and others, then I learned about wire and wireless communication technologies like Ethernet cables and Wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi). After that I learned about how to communicate these nodes with each other by using layers, from physical layer to application layer and some of their most used protocols such as ethernet protocols, flow and error control protocols and others. All those makes me able to understand how internet works and how it communicates devices by using of addresses like IP, Mac, Mask and port and others. After that I got some practical skills by creating and simulating networks with using of Cisco Packet Tracer software application. And i summarized all my knowledge on PDF file.

   3D Design is one of my preferable experiences, I started learning 3D design skills when I was 18 years old and I got a large experience in the last 5 years, I started by learning geometry and how to design 3D object, then I learned animation and dynamics skills applied on 3D objects, after that I learned how to texturing object with using of maps and creating and configuring an environment and applying a lighting source to the model then I got how to make different types of rendering like photorealistic rendering. I used different software platforms, first one is Cinema 4D and it is used for 3D design and environment creation and lighting configuration and 3D models animation, I used also Quixel libraries and substance painter for texturing with maps and I used Arnold render as Plugin on Cinema 4D for rendering. I used also Adobe after effect and premiere pro for editing videos and 3D rendering animations, I also had an experience on visual effect with using of adobe platforms and Cinema4D such as green screen masking, Tracking scenes and others, then I combined between 2D visual effect scenes and 3D models.

   Digital manufacturing, it started when I joined the engineering domain, because of my previous knowledge on 3D design, it was easy for me to design engineering systems on 3D and simplify studies and manufacturing of these systems, I used computer aided design (CAD) for designing, studying, controlling and simulating systems in 3D using CAD platforms like SolidWorks, Fusion360 and controlling platforms like MATLAB. I used also computer aided manufacturing (CAM) software platforms for manufacturing studies, configuration and simulation of CNC programmable machines with using of Fusion360 platform, and this in order to extract a G-code program thatâ€™s used for programming manufacturing processes of a CNC machine.

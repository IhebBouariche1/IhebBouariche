# Welcome ðŸ‘‹ 

##### This is my Github account, i'm an electrical engineer with a licentiate degree and a master in automation engineering with six years in the engineering field. I am continually developing my skills and would love to share my projects and experiences with you on this platform. I really enjoy learning, and I am a big fan of technology. I became interested in technology at a young age when I purchased my first computer in 2008. I have acquired additional skills through online courses, reading papers and books, and practicing, and I usually summarize my knowledge and experiences on papers or as projects. Some of my supplemental skills include artificial intelligence, 3D design, communication networks, digital manufacturing, Robotics and computer science engineering..

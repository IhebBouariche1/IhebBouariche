# Welcome ðŸ‘‹ 

##### Hello, I am Iheb Bouariche, an electrical engineer with a licentiate degree and a current master's student in automation engineering with five years of experience in the engineering field. I am continually developing my skills and would love to share my projects and experiences with you on this platform. I really enjoy self-directed learning, and I am a big fan of technology. I became interested in technology at a young age when I purchased my first computer in 2008. I have acquired additional skills through online courses, reading papers and books, and practicing, and I usually summarize my knowledge and experiences on papers or as projects. Some of my supplemental skills include artificial intelligence, 3D design, communication networks, and digital manufacturing..

#### My Career brief

![alt text](https://github.com/IhebBouariche1/IhebBouariche/blob/main/2.jpg)

   Throughout my academic classes in electrical and automation engineering, I have learned a great deal. I began by studying the mathematical representation of physical linear systems through differential equations on the time domain. I then delved into the mathematics behind the Fourier transform, which is used to transform differential equations on the time domain into transfer functions on the frequency domain for simplified dynamic system analysis. I learned a variety of techniques to study system performance on the frequency domain, such as pole positioning and diagrams like the Bode and Nyquist diagrams, among others. Next, I moved on to studying state representation systems with single/multiple inputs/outputs, which provides a full study of a system's internal dynamics.

Afterward, I learned about classical techniques for controlling systems, such as feedback control, PID control, and pole placement control, among others. I also learned how to move from continuous systems to discrete systems, which involves using digital calculators for physical systems control, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors, for better and more effective system control. These techniques are called digital control methods, such as numerical PID, RST, IMC (internal model controller), and others.

I also studied system identification, where I learned various methods for extracting transfer functions or mathematical models of a dynamical system using input-output signal measurement. Additionally, I learned about machine control, where I studied how to control a machine's velocity and current and implement feedback control with the use of a PID controller. I also learned about nonlinear systems and how to linearize, represent, study, and control these types of systems.

Lastly, I studied instrumentation, where I learned about sensor and actuator technologies, as well as PLCs devices used for controlling these systems using different languages such as Grafcet and Ladder language. I completed four practical professional training works and practical academic works, as well as supplement training works on my own, where I applied my theoretical knowledge to improve my experimental skills in instrumentation and system control.

   Artificial intelligence is one of the technologies that I love, and I have learned it by myself. I have learned about AI from different sources, such as online courses, articles, papers, and books. I started practicing AI by using Python and MATLAB, starting from supervised learning and data preprocessing, moving on to machine learning and deep learning. I have gained a good understanding of the theoretical and mathematical fundamentals behind these concepts. Finally, I applied my knowledge by working on mini-projects where I trained neural network models using Python and open-source libraries, and I summarized my findings in a report.

After mastering the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, I moved on to deep reinforcement learning, which enables machines to learn by interacting with the environment without using data. I began by learning the theoretical and mathematical details about RL and then worked on solving Markov decision problems with traditional RL algorithms. Later, I tackled more complex models using deep RL and my previous knowledge of deep learning neural networks.

In my latest projects, I applied AI to system control and solved various control systems problems using deep reinforcement learning on MATLAB software. This was an exciting and challenging area to work on, and I enjoyed applying my knowledge and skills to real-world problems.

  Communication networks is one of the most important technologies that I have learned. My network skills were developed by studying communication hardware devices and software applications. I began by studying different communication node devices, such as routers, switches, hubs, computers, and others. Then I learned about both wired and wireless communication technologies, such as Ethernet cables and Wi-Fi.

Next, I learned about how to communicate between these nodes by using layers, from the physical layer to the application layer, as well as some of their most commonly used protocols, such as Ethernet protocols, flow and error control protocols, and others. Understanding these layers and protocols made me able to understand how the internet works and how devices communicate with each other using addresses like IP, MAC, Mask, and Port, among others.

To gain practical skills, I created and simulated networks using the Cisco Packet Tracer software application. I also summarized all of my knowledge in a PDF file.

   I have a strong interest in 3D design, which I have been developing for the past 5 years. I started by learning the basics of geometry and how to design 3D objects. Then, I moved on to animation and dynamics, followed by texturing with maps and creating and configuring environments with lighting. I am experienced in different software platforms such as Cinema 4D, Quixel libraries, Substance Painter, Arnold Render, Adobe After Effects, and Premiere Pro. I have created different types of rendering, including photorealistic rendering, and have experience in visual effects such as green screen masking and tracking scenes. I have also combined 2D visual effect scenes and 3D models.

   Digital manufacturing is a field that I have gained experience in since I started working in engineering. My prior knowledge in 3D design made it easy for me to design engineering systems in 3D and simplify their manufacturing. For designing, studying, controlling, and simulating systems in 3D, I used computer-aided design (CAD) platforms such as SolidWorks, Fusion360, and controlling platforms such as MATLAB. I also used computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software platforms for manufacturing studies, configuration, and simulation of CNC programmable machines with the use of Fusion360. This allowed me to extract a G-code program for programming manufacturing processes of a CNC machine, making the manufacturing process more efficient and automated.

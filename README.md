###### My Career brief
   Hi, I'm IHEB BOUARICHE and Iâ€™m an Electrical engineer student with licentiate degree and automation engineer master student with 5 years in engineering domain, and I still developing my skills, Iâ€™m really enjoy learning by myself and Iâ€™m a big fan of technologies, I started to be interested on technologies when I was 8 years old, when I bought my first computer on 2008. I have supplement skills developed by online courses, papers, books and by doing practices, and usually I resume these formations information and experiences on papers. Some of my supplement skills are:  Artificial intelligent, 3D Design, Communication networks and Digital manufacturing.
 
   I learned from my academic class experience of electrical and automation engineering a lot of things, I started educating about mathematical representations of physical linear systems with differential equations on time domain. Then, I learned about the mathematics behind Fourier transform and how itâ€™s used for transforming differential equations on time domain to Transfer function on frequency domain and this is for simplifying studies of these systemâ€™s dynamics. I learned various techniques to study performance of these systems on frequency domain such as poles positions, diagrams as Bode diagram, Nyquist diagram and othersâ€¦ Then, I moved to state representation system with single/multiple inputs/outputs, state representation provides a full study of the intern dynamics of a system. After that, I moved to learning about classical techniques of controlling systems such as feedback control, PID control and pole placement control. And then, I learned how to move from continuous systems to discreet systems and that provides the using of digital calculator on controlling of physical systems (microcontroller and microprocessor), this transformation provides new and better techniques for controlling systems. And these techniques called digital control methods such as numerical PID, RST, IMC (internal model controller) and othersâ€¦ I learned also about system identification, where I learned different methods of how extracting transfer functions or mathematical models of a dynamical system with using the input-output signal measurement.  Another field is machines control where I learned how to control machineâ€™s velocity and current and implement a feedback control with using of a PID controller. I also learned about nonlinear systems and how to linearize, represent, study and control these nonlinear systems. Another field that I have learned is instrumentation where I studied about sensors and actuators technologies and PLCs devices used for controlling these systems and by using different languages such as Grafcet and Ladder language. I did four practical professional training works and also practical academic works and others by myself, where I applied my theoretical knowledge to improve my experimental skills on instrumentation and system control.

   Artificial intelligent is one of the technologies that I loved and I have learned by myself, I learned AI from different sources, formations, article, papers, books, and then I started practicing AI with using of Python Language and MATLAB software, I started by supervised learning from data and preprocessing of data to machine learning to deep learning, I understood the theorical and mathematical fundamentals behind these concepts and finally I did some mini projects where I trained AI Neural Networks models with using python language and open source libraries and data, finally I resumed these informations on one report. I moved then to Reinforcement learning fundamentals then to deep Reinforcement Learning where machines could be train and learn by defining only an objective and with its interaction with the environment without using of data. I started by learning theorical and mathematical details of RL, then I worked on solving Markov decision problems with traditional RL algorithms, then I moved to more complex models, and they were solved by using Deep RL and with using of my previous knowledge on deep learning neural networks. Finally, I applied AI on system control and I solved different types of control systems problems by Deep reinforcement learning on MATLAB software.

   Communication networks, one of the most important technologies that I have learned. I got my networks skills by learning communicationâ€™s hardware devices and software application, first of all I started by studying different communication nodes devices such as routers, switches, hubs, computers and others, then I learned about wire and wireless communication technologies like Ethernet cables and Wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi). After that I learned about how to communicate these nodes with each other by using layers, from physical layer to application layer and some of their most used protocols such as ethernet protocols, flow and error control protocols and others. All those makes me able to understand how internet works to communicate devices and the uses of addresses like IP, Mac, Mask and port and others. After that I got some practical skills by creating and simulating networks with using of Cisco Packet Tracer software application.  

   3D Design is one of my preferable experiences, I started learning 3D design skills when I was 18 years old and I got a large experience in the last 5 years, I started by learning geometry and how to design 3D object, then I learned animation and dynamics skills applied on 3D objects, after that I learned how to texturing object with using of maps and creating and configuring an environment and apply lighting to the model then I got how to make different types of rendering like photorealistic rendering. I used different software platforms, like Cinema 4D is used for 3D design and environment and lighting and animation, I used also Quixel libraries and substance painter for textures maps and I used Arnold render as Plugin on Cinema 4D for rendering. I used also Adobe after effect and premiere pro for editing videos of 3D rendering animations, I also did visual effect with these two platforms such as green screen masking and others then I combined between 2D visual effect scenes and 3D object.

   Digital manufacturing, it started when I joined the engineering domain, because of my previous knowledge on 3D design, it was easy for me to design engineering systems on 3D and simplify studies and manufacturing of these systems, I used computer aided design (CAD) for designing, studying, controlling and simulating systems in 3D using CAD platforms like SolidWorks, Fusion360 and controlling platforms like MATLAB. I used also computer aided manufacturing (CAM) software platforms for manufacturing studies, configuration and simulation of CNC programmable machines with using of Fusion360 platform, and that is in order to extract a G-code program thatâ€™s used for programming manufacturing processes of a CNC machine.
